# Task 4: Real-Time CPU Usage Simulator
## Objective
 Simulate CPU usage percentages for a system, collect readings, and analyze overloads and stability.
## Real-Life Use Case
Useful for server monitoring, autoscaling tests, capacity planning, and performance dashboards.
Requirements Implemented
- Generate CPU load values in the range 0–100%
- Collect 50 readings (simulated, one per second)
- Store readings in an array
- Identify and report:
- Overload events (> 85%) — list and count
- Average CPU usage across readings
- Stable iterations where CPU is between 40–60% inclusive
